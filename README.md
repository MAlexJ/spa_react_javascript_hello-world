### React

#### component: BrowserRouter

basename: string

The base URL for all locations. 
If your app is served from a sub-directory on your server, youâ€™ll want to set this to the sub-directory. 
A properly formatted basename should have a leading slash, but no trailing slash.

#### hook: useLocation

How to Pass Data Across Routes with React Router

URL parameters are a good way of passing data from page to page in a React application.
But what if you don't want that data to show in your URL?
Here's a great way to achieve that using the useLocation hook that React Router provides.

#### hook: useState

Two way binding more than one input in React Hooks

link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61373904/two-way-binding-more-than-one-input-in-react-w-hooks

The hooks and handler:

```
const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
const [newUser, setNewUser] = useState("");
const handleChange = e =>
    e.target.name === "message"
        ? setMessage(e.target.value)
        : e.target.name === "user"
        ? setNewUser(e.target.value)
        : "";
```

The inputs:

```
<input name="message" value={message} onChange={handleChange} />
<input name="user" value={newUser} onChange={handleChange} />
```

two options:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
    const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
    const [newUser, setNewUser] = useState("");

    const handleChange = e =>
        e.target.name === "message"
            ? setMessage(e.target.value)
            : e.target.name === "user"
            ? setNewUser(e.target.value)
            : "";

    const [message2, setMessage2] = useState("");
    const [newUser2, setNewUser2] = useState("");
    const handleChange2 = (e, name) =>
        name === "message" ? setMessage2(e.target.value) : name === "user" ? setNewUser2(e.target.value) : "";

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h2>Option 1</h2>
            <input name="message" value={message} onChange={handleChange} />
            <input name="user" value={newUser} onChange={handleChange} />
            <hr />
            <h2>Option 2</h2>
            <input value={message2} onChange={e => handleChange2(e, "message")} />
            <input value={newUser2} onChange={e => handleChange2(e, "user")} />
            <hr />
        </div>
    );
}
```
